def DRAMQueue(name: str, operandA: Tensor, *, num_entries: int) -> Tensor:
    """
    Explicit operation in the graph to buffer the input operand data through
    DRAM to its consumer(s).

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str
        Op name, unique to the module, or leave blank to autoset

    num_entries: int
        configuration for the number of entries that can be stored in the queue.
        num_entries shouldn't have default value because if queue turns out to be static it should
        have num_entries equal to microbatch_size.
        Only in special cases, when we are sure we will need less space than microbatch size, we can
        set num_entries to something less than microbatch_size.

    Returns
