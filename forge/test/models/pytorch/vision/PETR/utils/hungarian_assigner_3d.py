    """Computes one-to-one matching between predictions and ground truth.
    This class computes an assignment between the targets and the predictions
    based on the costs. The costs are weighted sum of three components:
    classification cost, regression L1 cost and regression iou cost. The
    targets don't include the no_object, so generally there are more
    predictions than targets. After the one-to-one matching, the un-matched
    are treated as backgrounds. Thus each query prediction will be assigned
    with `0` or a positive integer indicating the ground truth index:
    - 0: negative sample, no assigned gt
    - positive integer: positive sample, index (1-based) of assigned gt
    Args:
        cls_weight (int | float, optional): The scale factor for classification
            cost. Default 1.0.
        bbox_weight (int | float, optional): The scale factor for regression
            L1 cost. Default 1.0.
        iou_weight (int | float, optional): The scale factor for regression
            iou cost. Default 1.0.
        iou_calculator (dict | optional): The config for the iou calculation.
            Default type `BboxOverlaps2D`.
        iou_mode (str | optional): "iou" (intersection over union), "iof"
                (intersection over foreground), or "giou" (generalized
                intersection over union). Default "giou".
