# GENERAL OP SUPPORT TEST PLAN:
# 1. Operand type - any supported type
# 2. Operand source(s):
# (-)  2.1 From another op
#       - Operator -> input
# (-)  2.2 From DRAM queue
#       - Operator is first node in network 
#       - Input_queue flag = false
# (-)  2.3 Const Inputs (const eval pass)
#       - Operator where all inputs are constants.
# (-)  2.4 From host
#       - Input tensor as input of network
#       - Operator is first node in network 
#       - Input_queue flag = true
# 3 Operand shapes type(s):
# (-)  3.1 Full tensor (i.e. full expected shape)
#       - 3-4 by default P1 (high prioriy)
#       - 2, 5, ++ include P2 (lower prioriy)
# (-)  3.2 Tensor reduce on one or more dims to 1
#       - Vector
#       - Only one dim is not equal to 1
# (-)  3.3 Scalar P2
#       - Create tensor of dimension equal to 0 (tensor from scalar) or just to use scalar as simple value
# 4. Operand / output size of dimensions (few examples of each, 10 values total)
# (-)  4.1 Divisible by 32
# (-)  4.2 Prime numbers
# (-)  4.3 Very large (thousands, 10s of thousands)
#       - 100x100, 100x1000
#       - maybe nightly only
# (-)  4.4 Extreme ratios between height/width
#      4.5 ...probably many more interesting combinations here
# 5. Data format - all supported formats
# (-)  5.1 Output DF
# (-)  5.2 Intermediate DF
# (-)  5.3 Accumulation DF
# (-)  5.4 Operand DFs
#       - Fix HiFi4 for math fidelity value
# (-) 6. Math fidelity - LoFi, HiFi2a, Hifi2b, Hifi3, Hifi4
#       - Fix fp16b (default) for data format value
# (-) 7. Special attributes - if applicable.. like approx_mode for Exp, for example
# (-) 8. Special cases - if applicable
# 9. Variable number of operands - if applicable
# (-) Few representative values
# (-) Reuse inputs for selected operators
