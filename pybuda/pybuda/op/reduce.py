    ----------

        First operand

    dim: int

    groups: int
        Number of groups to reduce along dim. Must be a factor of the dimension size.
        i.e: GroupReduce(-2, 32) on a tensor of shape (1, 1, 320, 1024) will reduce to (1, 1, 32, 1024)
             such that nth row on the new tensor is the average of the nth section of 10 rows (320 // 32) on the old tensor.
    
    keep_dims: bool
        Whether or not to keep the dimension size averaged groups such that each element in a group is replaced with the average of the group.
        i.e GroupReduce(-2, 2, keep_dims=True) on a tensor of shape (4, 1) will reduce to (4, 1)
            Say we have [[1], [2], [3], [4]] as the original tensor. The new tensor will be [[1.5], [1.5], [3.5], [3.5]]
            If keep_dims=False, the new tensor will be [[1.5], [3.5]]
