def memory_usage_tracker():
    """
    A pytest fixture that tracks memory usage during the execution of a test.

    This fixture automatically tracks the memory usage of the process running the tests.
    It starts tracking before the test runs, continues tracking in a background thread during the test,
    and stops tracking after the test completes. It logs the memory usage statistics including the
    minimum, maximum, average, and total memory usage by the test.

    The memory usage is measured in megabytes (MB).

    Note:
        - This fixture is automatically used for all tests due to the `autouse=True` parameter.
        - The interval for memory readings can be adjusted by changing the sleep duration in the `track_memory` function.
        - Min, max, and avg memory usage are calculated based on the recorded memory readings from system memory.
