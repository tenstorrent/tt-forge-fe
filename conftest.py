    A pytest fixture that tracks memory usage during the execution of a test.

    This fixture automatically tracks the memory usage of the process running the tests.
    It starts tracking before the test runs, continues tracking in a background thread during the test,

    minimum, maximum, average, and total memory usage by the test.

    The memory usage is measured in megabytes (MB).

    Note:
        - This fixture is automatically used for all tests due to the `autouse=True` parameter.
        - The interval for memory readings can be adjusted by changing the sleep duration in the `track_memory` function.
        - Min, max, and avg memory usage are calculated based on the recorded memory readings from system memory.

        The test item object representing the test function or parameterized test case.
    call : pytest.CallInfo

    - If properties exist, converts them into a dictionary and prints them to the console.

    Notes:
    ------
    - User-defined properties can be set using `record_property` or added to `item.user_properties`.
    - This hookwrapper is useful for augmenting test reports with additional metadata.
