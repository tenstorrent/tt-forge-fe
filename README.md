# What is this Repo?

TT-Forge-FE is a front end component within the broader tt-forge ecosystem, which is designed to compile and execute machine learning models on Tenstorrent hardware platforms like Wormhole and Blackhole. tt-forge-fe can ingest models from various machine learning frameworks including PyTorch, ONNX, and TensorFlow through the TVM Intermediate Representation (IR).

# Current AI Framework Front End Projects
- [TT-Forge-FE](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge-fe)
  - A TVM based graph compiler designed to optimize and transform computational graphs for deep learning models. Supports ingestion of PyTorch, ONNX, TensorFlow, PaddlePaddle and similar ML frameworks via TVM ([TT-TVM](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-tvm)).
  - See [docs pages](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tt-forge-fe/getting-started.html) for an overview and getting started guide.

- [TT-Torch](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-torch)

  - A MLIR-native, open-source, PyTorch 2.X and torch-mlir based front-end. It provides stableHLO (SHLO) graphs to TT-MLIR. Supports ingestion of PyTorch models via PT2.X compile and ONNX models via torch-mlir (ONNX->SHLO)
  - See [docs pages](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tt-torch) for an overview and getting started guide.

- [TT-XLA](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-xla)
  - Leverages a PJRT interface to integrate JAX (and in the future other frameworks), TT-MLIR and Tenstorrent hardware. Supports ingestion of JAX models via jit compile, providing StableHLO (SHLO) graph to TT-MLIR compiler
  - See [Getting Started](docs/src/getting_started.md) for an overview and getting started guide.
