# What is this Repo?

tt-forge-fe is a front end component within the broader tt-forge ecosystem, which is designed to compile and execute machine learning models on Tenstorrent hardware platforms like Wormhole and Blackhole. tt-forge-fe can ingest models from various machine learning frameworks including PyTorch, ONNX, and TensorFlow through the TVM Intermediate Representation (IR).

# Current AI Framework Front End Projects
- [tt-forge-fe](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge-fe)
  - A TVM based graph compiler designed to optimize and transform computational graphs for deep learning models. Supports ingestion of PyTorch, ONNX, TensorFlow, PaddlePaddle and similar ML frameworks via TVM ([tt-tvm](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-tvm)).
  - See [docs pages](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tt-forge-fe/getting-started.html) for an overview and getting started guide.

- [tt-torch](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-torch)

  - A MLIR-native, open-source, PyTorch 2.X and torch-mlir based front-end. It provides stableHLO (SHLO) graphs to `tt-mlir`. Supports ingestion of PyTorch models via PT2.X compile and ONNX models via torch-mlir (ONNX->SHLO)
  - See [docs pages](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tt-torch) for an overview and getting started guide.

- [tt-xla](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-xla)
  - Leverages a PJRT interface to integrate JAX (and in the future other frameworks), `tt-mlir` and Tenstorrent hardware. Supports ingestion of JAX models via jit compile, providing StableHLO (SHLO) graph to `tt-mlir` compiler
  - See [getting_started.md](docs/src/getting_started.md) for an overview and getting started guide.
