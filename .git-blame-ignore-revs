# Git has the ability to ignore provided commits in git-blame command (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-blameignoreRevsFile).
# This is useful for large formatting/refactoring commits that hides initial changes.
#
# This file contains commits that are not important for blaming. You can set this file as a default git-blame ignore file with:
# git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

# format everything #405 (https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge-onnx/pull/405)
